Many informative results can come from the &quot;employees table&quot; using the &quot;Jobs table&quot; but I use them for
finding how many employees can earn less and more than the minimum and earn more than maximum
salary. I can say System analysis staff earn less than the minimum but only two of them can earn more
than the minimum. Surprisingly, nobody can earn more than the maximum.
