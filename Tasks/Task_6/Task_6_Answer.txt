I can say it is so challenging question because I must think about many aspects which are related
to database users. I think growth is so important for every company and if you want to grow you
must scale your business for getting a share from some specific market. Employers for each
country can be useful for database users which audit can make calculations of revenue and cost
per employee and human resource department can analyze the performance of staff based on
each country according to their numbers.
